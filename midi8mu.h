// TRACT8 - Music Thing 8mu dispatch.
//
// Decodes the 8mu factory MIDI mapping. Nothing needs configuring in the
// 8mu web editor: plug it into the front USB-C jack and play.
//
// The factory mapping, confirmed against musicthing.co.uk/8mu.html:
//
//   CC 34-41   faders 1-8, left to right with the cable on the right
//   CC 42-49   accelerometer gestures:
//                42 lift front   43 lift back
//                44 lift left    45 lift right
//                46 rotate CW    47 rotate CCW
//                48 not inverted 49 inverted
//   Notes      the four buttons, C2/C3/C4/C5 (36/48/60/72) out of the box
//
// Mapped here as:
//
//   CC 34  fader 1   OPENNESS   vowel cube, close <-> open
//   CC 41  fader 8   FRONT      vowel cube, back  <-> front
//   CC 36  fader 3   BREATH     buzz <-> noise
//   CC 37  fader 4   PITCH      F0, 50..500 Hz
//   CC 38  fader 5   BRIGHT     spectral tilt
//   CC 35, 39, 40    unassigned
//   CC 40  fader 7   VOLUME     base level
//   CC 42/43         VOLUME TRIM  lift front/back, bipolar, adds to it
//   CC 44/45         ROUND      lift left/right, bipolar
//
// THE ACCELEROMETER CCs ARE GESTURE MAGNITUDES, NOT BIPOLAR AXES. Each
// direction is its own controller reporting how much of that gesture is
// happening, and a controller lying flat does not necessarily send 0 on
// any of them. Nothing here may assume a resting value: the volume and
// round axes calibrate themselves from the first message they see. Two
// hardware rounds were lost to assuming otherwise - see midi8mu.cpp.
//   CC 49            MUTE       LOW value = turned over = muted
//   CC 46, 47        unassigned
//   Note 36 (C2)     MUTE while held - silences the card
//   Note 48 (C3)     unvoiced noise gate
//   Note 60 (C4)     plosive burst
//   Note 72 (C5)     formant freeze, and adds breath
//
// FADERS 1 AND 8 CARRY THE VOWEL, not 1 and 2. They are the outermost
// faders, so the two axes that get played constantly sit under a thumb and
// a little finger with the whole hand spanning the device. Adjacent faders
// need the same finger twice or a wrist move. This was reported from
// playing, and it is the kind of thing only playing tells you.
//
// Faders 2, 6 and 7 are deliberately unassigned. Five controls that each
// mean something beat eight that must be operated as a chord - the version
// that put one filter band on each fader was unplayable.
//
// Everything else - other CCs, other notes, pitch bend, sysex, program
// change, clock - is silently dropped. Channel-agnostic.

// THESE ARE *LIFT* GESTURES. Each one reads 0 when the device is level and

// centre detent at 64.
//
// Getting this wrong is what made the volume feel broken: treating 64 as
// the neutral point meant full volume happened only at some specific
// half-lifted angle, with the level position silent. Reported as "it feels
// like only a very specific angle has volume", which is exactly what the
// arithmetic predicts.
//

//
//     axis = lift_one - lift_other        range -127 .. +127

// That is genuinely bipolar, and both halves must be read to get it -
// unlike a complementary pair, here each half carries real information.
// These name the PHYSICAL gesture, matching the 8mu documentation. The
// volume sense is inverted where the axis is computed, not by lying about
// which CC is which - see UpdateVolume() in midi8mu.cpp. Lifting the BACK
// swells and lifting the FRONT ducks, which is the way round it was asked
