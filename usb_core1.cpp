// TRACT8 - Core 1 USB host task pump.
//
// Core 1 owns the whole USB stack and does nothing else. Core 0 runs the
// 48 kHz audio interrupt via ComputerCard::Run().
//
// This split is the opposite of what might seem natural (DSP on the second
// core, housekeeping on the first), and it is deliberate. ComputerCard
// installs its audio interrupt on whichever core calls Run(), and every
// working USB-host card on this hardware - the official ComputerCard
// midi_host example included - puts audio on Core 0 and the USB pump on
// Core 1. tuh_task() is a blocking-ish polled loop with no deadline of its
// own; the audio ISR has a hard 20.8 us one. Giving the ISR the core that
// is not also servicing USB interrupts is the safer arrangement.
//
// The MIDI host driver is rppicomidi/usb_midi_host (MIT), vendored
// unmodified in usb_midi_host.c/.h and registered through TinyUSB's
// usbh_app_driver_get_cb() hook in usb_midi_host_app_driver.c. Pico SDK
// 2.2.0 ships TinyUSB 0.18, which has no MIDI host class driver of its own.
