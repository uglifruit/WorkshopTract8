//
// THE LESSON THAT COST TWO HARDWARE ROUNDS: the 8mu's accelerometer CCs
// are GESTURE MAGNITUDES, not a bipolar axis with a known resting value.
// "Lift front" and "lift back" are two independent controllers that each
// report how much of that gesture is happening, and a controller lying
// flat does not necessarily send 0 on either of them.
//
// The first version computed
//
//     volume = 32767 - lift_back + lift_front
//
// which assumed lift_back rests at 0. If it rests anywhere above zero the
// card is quiet or silent from the moment it boots, and - this is the part
// that made it look broken rather than wrong - the volume is already
// clamped at the bottom, so moving the controller appears to do nothing at
// all. Reported from hardware as "tilt isn't doing volume now".
//
// The fix is to assume nothing about resting values and CALIBRATE. The
// first message on each axis establishes that axis's rest point; from then
// on only the DEVIATION from rest is used. That works whatever the 8mu
// happens to send when level, and it needs no configuration.
// The accelerometer gestures are LIFTS: each reads 0 when the device is
// level and rises as that side is lifted. A level 8mu sends 0 on all four.
//
// So each physical axis is the DIFFERENCE of its pair, -127..+127, zero
// when level. Both halves are read, because here each carries real
// information - unlike a complementary pair, where one is redundant.
