"""End-to-end signal level through TRACT8's chain. THE GAIN-STAGING AUTHORITY.

This test exists because the card came back from its first hardware run
SILENT except for plosives - which are summed after the filter bank, so
their working proved the ISR, the DAC and the output path were all fine and
localised the fault to the bank or its gain staging.

The bug it found: the bandpass sections have a peak voltage gain far BELOW
unity at their centre frequencies. An RBJ constant-skirt bandpass has a peak
gain of alpha/a0, not 1.0 - and alpha is proportional to sin(w0)/2Q, so at
250 Hz with Q=4 that is about 0.004. Combined with the >>3 before the bank
and the >>4 after it, the chain threw away roughly 78 dB and the output
never left the DAC's zero code.

filter_check.py did not catch this: it measured each band's response
NORMALISED to its own peak, which is the right way to check centre
frequency and Q and the wrong way to check level. This file measures
absolute amplitude in DAC counts, which is the number that decides whether
anyone hears anything.

Checks:
  1. Per-band peak gain at centre frequency (the thing that was wrong).
  2. Full chain level for a buzz at F0 through a real vowel, in DAC counts.
  3. The same for noise.
  4. Headroom: worst case must not overflow int32 or clip the DAC.
  5. The click sits under the voice, measured against the VOICE.
  6. Breath changes the character of the sound, not its level.
  7. The plosive occupies a band - neither white noise nor a thump.
  8. The default burst is a consonant length, not a drum hit.
  9. Band gains smooth per sample and converge exactly (no stuck buzz).
 10. ADC jitter on a still knob does not reach the band gains.
