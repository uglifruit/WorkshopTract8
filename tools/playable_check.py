"""Can the card actually be played? Regression test for the control model.

TWO ROUNDS OF HARDWARE FEEDBACK SHAPED THIS FILE, and both said the same
thing in different words.

v1.1.0: "with faders moving, the main knob doesn't do anything." The faders
wrote band gains directly and latched the panel out on first touch.

v1.2.0: "I would prefer the vowel sounds just on three sliders. It's too
hard to try to manipulate the partials." That is the deeper of the two.
Per-band control is the WRONG ABSTRACTION for playing, however well behaved
it is made: a vowel is a position of the mouth, not eight independent
numbers, and asking a player to operate seven faders as a chord is asking
them to solve the Voder's original problem - the one its operators trained
for months to overcome.

So the partials left the interface entirely. Two controls place a point in
the vowel square (openness = F1, front = F2) and the eight band gains are a
bilinear blend of four corner vowels. Everything a mouth can do is reachable
with two fingers.

What this file pins down is that the space is genuinely playable: both axes
do something wherever you are in it, the corners are exact, no position
produces silence or a hole, and the vowels that are not corners are still
reachable inside it.

Checks:
  1. All eight cube corners reproduce their vowels exactly.
  2. All three axes move the spectrum, everywhere in the cube.
  3. UH and OH are both reachable inside the cube.
  4. No position in the cube is silent or holed.
  5. Brightness tilts without pinning any band.
