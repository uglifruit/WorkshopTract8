"""BABBLE alt-boot: does one gate and three knobs actually chatter?

Hold the switch DOWN at power-on. Each knob then drives several parameters
at once, so the card talks from a single sustained gate with no controller
attached. Normal mode maps one knob to one parameter, which is right for
playing deliberately and wrong for getting a texture going quickly.

  MAIN  vowel diagonal + pitch      one knob walks through vowels
  X     chatter rate + brightness   fast and bright together
  Y     breath + rounding, opposed  hum at one end, whisper at the other

TWO TRAPS THIS FILE GUARDS.

The first is the boot detection, and it is a trap two sibling cards fell
into. The switch reads DOWN until it settles, so latching the mode on "Down
seen at any point" latches it on EVERY boot - WorkshopZX and WorkshopBio
both shipped that bug. The reading must be taken ONCE, after the full
0.5 s boot window, by which point the filter has settled from any start.

The second is the chatter rate. The syllable and the gap between syllables
have to be related, or the mode does not do what its name says. The first
version ran the rate from the click length itself (125 Hz, a buzz) to
250 ms while the click could be a full second, so bursts overlapped into a
wash - wrong at both ends. It now runs 2 to 20 Hz with each syllable voiced
for the first third of its period.

THE CHATTER NO LONGER FIRES CLICKS. It gated a plosive on every syllable,
which put a click on the front of each one and made the mode read as
percussion rather than as speech. Reported as too much, and it was: the
chatter is a voice, not a drum. Consonants are still available from Pulse
In 1, which triggers clicks in every mode - so the player chooses when to
have them instead of being given them by default.

Checks:
  1. The mode is read once after the window, never latched on a sighting.
  2. MAIN sweeps the vowel diagonally and moves pitch with it.
  3. X gives a usable chatter range, with syllables always separated.
  4. Y crossfades breath against rounding.
  5. A held gate chatters on its own; no gate means silence.
  6. The chatter fires NO clicks - those come only from Pulse In 1.
