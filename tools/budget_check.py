"""Cycle budget estimate for TRACT8's audio ISR.

READ THIS BEFORE TRUSTING ANY NUMBER BELOW.

Every figure in this file is a PREDICTION, derived from instruction counts
and published cycle timings for the Cortex-M0+. It is not a measurement,
and on this hardware that distinction has bitten before: the sibling card
WorkshopSpectral modelled its DSP load at 51% and measured 231% on real
silicon - a factor of four and a half out - because the model did not
account for flash-resident helper calls and XIP cache contention.

The authority on this card's cost is CV Out 2, which reports measured
microseconds per sample scaled against the 20.83 us budget. When TRACT8 has
run on hardware, replace the summary line at the bottom of this file with
the reading from that pin, and treat any disagreement as this model being
wrong rather than the hardware.

What this file IS good for: showing where the cost sits, so that if the
measured figure comes back too high there is a ranked list of things to
attack. It is a map, not a scale.
