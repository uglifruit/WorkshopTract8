// TRACT8 - a Voder for the Music Thing Modular Workshop System Computer.
//
// An eight-band reimplementation of the 1939 Bell Labs Voder, played from a
// Music Thing 8mu over USB MIDI Host or from the card's own panel.
//
// Structure:
//   voder.cpp     excitation and the 8-band filter bank
//                                       (verified: tools/filter_check.py,
//                                                  tools/excite_check.py)
//   vowels.h      vowel gain vectors    (verified: tools/vowel_check.py)
//   midi8mu.cpp   8mu CC/note dispatch  (verified: tools/midi_check.py)
//   usb_core1.cpp Core 1 USB host pump
//   main.cpp      panel, CV, LEDs, core scheduling
//
// Jacks:
//   Audio In 1   exciter  external audio, summed with buzz and noise
//   Audio In 2   volume   CV, adds to the fader
//   CV In 1      pitch    1V/oct
//   CV In 2      formant  bipolar, sweeps the vowel cube diagonally
//   Pulse In 1   click    trigger
//   Pulse In 2   glottal  gate
//
// All four CV inputs ADD to whatever the panel or the 8mu has set, rather
// than replacing it. That is what makes the card useful fed from random
// voltages: a slow random into CV 2 wanders the vowel around wherever the
// controls are parked, and gates into the pulses chatter it, without ever
// needing the patch to supply a sensible absolute value.
//
// The Voder's controls map onto this card as:
//   wrist bar (buzz/hiss)  -> notes C2/C3, Knob 3, Pulse In 2
//   foot pedal (pitch)     -> accelerometer CC 42/43, CV In 1, Knob 1 page 2
//   ten filter keys        -> 8mu faders CC 34-41, Knob 1/2 on the panel
//   three stop keys        -> note C4, Pulse In 1, Switch down
