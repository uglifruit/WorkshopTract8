// TRACT8 - the Voder engine.
//
// An eight-band reimplementation of the 1939 Bell Labs Voder: two raw
// excitation sources (a buzz and a hiss) fed through a bank of fixed
// bandpass filters whose gains are the performance.
//
//   1. Excitation. A bandlimited sawtooth at F0 for voiced sounds, white
//      noise for unvoiced ones, mixed continuously. Either may be replaced
//      wholesale by an external signal on Audio In 1.
//   2. Filter bank. Eight parallel 2-pole bandpass sections at fixed
//      centres, each scaled by its own Q15 gain.
//   3. Plosives. A short noise burst summed after the bank, for the stop
//      consonants the original had dedicated keys for.
//
// Everything on the hot path is fixed point. Floats appear exactly once,
// in VoderInit(), where the biquad coefficients are derived - see the note
// there for why that is safe.
//
// Verified by: tools/filter_check.py (band geometry, Q15 quantisation,
// stability), tools/excite_check.py (aliasing, noise flatness).
